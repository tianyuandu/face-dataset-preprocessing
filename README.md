# face-dataset-preprocessing
Our method used Markus Mathias's method (ECCV14,http://markusmathias.bitbucket.org/2014_eccv_face_detection/) to detect face in the helen facial dataset, then we cropped the facial image and saved the local landmarks as a no-background facial dataset.

the main function is 'detect_faces.m'.Other matlab files work as their names.
